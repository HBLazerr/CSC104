I used the text from the Constitution link above and styled it using CSS. I experimented with the different properties that 
affected text display and various text formats to create an effective and interesting page design. I used the index.html 
posted and made some changes myself. I created a style.css to add some CSS styling.

index.html - outputs the content which is the article 1 and 10 sections with descriptions.
style.css - outputs styling for the content in the index.html. It includes an svg background, navbar styling, colors, and more.
