                Hi, my name is Daniel Chavez. My interests include cars, outer space, programming, and going to the gym.
                I enjoy going on family vacations, going paintballing, playing video games, off-roading, and overall
                just hanging out with friends.
            </p>

            <h2>Web Development Experience</h2>
            <p>
                Worked on both front and back-end projects located in my GitHub which showcase the skills I use to this
                day. I certainly enjoyed the freedom in many of these works.
            </p>
